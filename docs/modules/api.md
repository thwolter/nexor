# `nexor.api`

## Overview

`nexor.api` is currently a placeholder module that exists to grow shared API helpers or routers over time.
At the moment there are no concrete exports beyond the empty module, but the package exposes this namespace so
that future additions can land without breaking consumers.

TODO: document concrete helpers once this module gains functionality.

## API Reference

```{note}
This module is kept to reserve the namespace for shared API helpers. See [`nexor`](../index.md) for the modules that are currently populated.
